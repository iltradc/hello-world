This was created while going through the **GitHub Guide** "*Hello World*"

I am interested in learning git so that I can collaborate with colleagues more easily on software development projects.

I am also interested in using git to track **LaTex** files. I would like to learn how to write **LaTex** documentation for my software projects complete with a makefile to compile the final **LaTex** pdf file.
